# TTS Fidelity

> **Diagnostic Metric**: If the agent's spoken audio doesn't match what it intended to say, the user receives incorrect information regardless of how good the text reasoning was.

## Overview

Audio-based metric that evaluates whether the assistant's **spoken audio** accurately represents the intended text, using an audio LLM for multimodal analysis. This metric evaluates the speech output regardless of how it was produced — whether by a separate TTS engine or generated directly by an audio-native model. Specifically, it checks that all words from the intended text are present (no missing words), no extra words were added (no insertions), words are spoken correctly (no substitutions), and key entities are accurately conveyed (dates, names, numbers, codes, addresses).

> [!NOTE]
> By default, this diagnostic metric is excluded. Enable it explicitly with `--metrics tts_fidelity` (or include it in a comma-separated `--metrics` list).

### Capabilities Measured

- **Speech Synthesis**: Measures whether the TTS engine (cascade) or the model's direct audio generation (audio-native) accurately produces the intended text as spoken audio.

## How It Works

### Evaluation Method

- **Type**: Audio Judge (multimodal LLM with audio input)
- **Model**: Gemini 3 Flash
- **Granularity**: Per-turn (each assistant turn evaluated independently)

### Input Data

Uses the following MetricContext fields:
- `audio_assistant_path`: Path to assistant-only audio file
- `intended_assistant_turns`: What the assistant intended to say

### Evaluation Methodology

The judge compares intended text against spoken audio, focusing on:

- **TTS-critical entities**: Names, dates, times, codes, dollar amounts, flight numbers — these are the highest-priority items
- **Error types**: Missing words, added words, wrong words, entity errors

**Special handling:**
- Minor pronunciation variations that don't change meaning are acceptable
- Filler words (um, uh) that don't affect core content are ignored
- Interruption tags (e.g., `[likely cut off by user]`, `[assistant interrupts]`) are non-spoken metadata in the intended text — words in regions flagged by these tags as likely not spoken are not penalized
- Missing words at END of LAST turn only are not penalized (audio cutoff)

### Scoring

- **Scale**: 0-1 (binary per turn)
  - 1: High Fidelity — audio accurately says all words from intended text
  - 0: Low Fidelity — missing, added, or wrong words detected
- **Normalization**: Already 0-1 scale
- **Aggregation**: Mean across all assistant turns

    }
